Hello! We are from Nusantara 2017, the third annual Indonesian Festival held by BISA. This year, we decided to carry out the theme: East Meets West. With this theme, we want to bring the rich and diverse Indonesian culture to the West, and showcase how our indigenous culture assimilates with western culture. Nusantara 2017: East Meets West will take place in West Crescent Circle of University of California, Berkeley on April 15th at 3pm-9pm.
